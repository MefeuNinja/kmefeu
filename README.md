<h1 align="left">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matheus CorrÃªa</h1><p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=kmefeu" alt="kmefeu" /> </p>

Understand the relationships between humans and technology is a really fascinating thing to me. I believe that after each little step forward in science and technology, humanity behaviors change a lot. For me it would be amazing, as a creator, a designer and a future engineer, to contribute to one of these steps. There is nothing that makes me curious that Iâ€™m not interested to learn - and, as I've found, there are a lot of things that Iâ€™m curious about.
